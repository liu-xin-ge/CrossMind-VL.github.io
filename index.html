            How do humans perceive naturalistic social scenes, especially in dynamic contexts? Similarity judgments offer critical insight into the mental representations humans use to perceive actions, form categories, 
            and predict behavior. Real-world perception is complex and dynamic, involving features that static representations fully cannot capture. While prior research has focused on static scenes, less is understood about 
            the features driving human similarity judgments in dynamic settings and their alignment with representations learned by deep neural networks (DNNs). To address this, we collected ~65,000+ similarity 
            judgments with a triplet odd-one-out task generated from a curated dataset of 250 three-second videos depicting everyday human actions—a scale far exceeding comparable studies. We then constructed a similarity 
            matrix for all 250 videos, computing <em>p(i, j)</em>, the likelihood of participants selecting stimuli <i>i</i> and <i>j</i> as similar when paired with different third videos. Finally, these similarity judgments were compared to human ratings 
            across visual and social scene features, fMRI responses, video DNN extractions, and word embeddings derived from human-written captions, using representational similarity analysis (RSA). The results reveal striking patterns 
            in human perception: word embeddings of video captions, reflecting how humans choose to describe the videos, showed the strongest correlation with overall similarity judgments, followed by ratings of “intimacy” 
            (relational closeness) and video DNN embeddings. Similarity judgements correlated significantly with neural responses in regions, including EBA, LOC, STS (lateral stream) and FFA (ventral stream), but not early visual 
            (EVC) or scene-specific (PPA) areas, underscoring the dominance of social over scene features. Together, these findings highlight the alignment between linguistic descriptions and cognitive strategies, revealing how verbal 
            encodings of social features capture key mental processes shaping our understanding of dynamic social scenes.<br><br><br><br><br>

                To reveal the representations that best align with human perception of social events, we began with a set of 3-second social videos from the MiT dataset. For each video, we extracted behavioral features 
                (e.g., ratings of positivity and interaction type) and deep neural network (DNN) features from prior benchmarking work. Each of these sources was used to generate a representational similarity matrix (RSM) 
                that quantified how similarly the videos were represented by each source. In parallel, we collected human similarity judgments using a triplet odd-one-out task, where participants viewed sets of three videos 
                and selected the one least similar to the others. Aggregating over thousands of such choices, we constructed a similarity probability: the similarity probability for each video pair was computed as the proportion 
                of times that pair was judged as similar when presented together. This resulted in a 200 x 200 matrix capturing perceived similarity among all video pairs in the train set. Finally, we performed representational
                similarity analysis (RSA) to directly compare the human-derived similarity probability matrix with RSMs derived from behavioral features and DNNs. This framework allowed us to systematically assess which source 
                best captures the structure of human social perception.

            <b>(2)</b> deep neural networks—especially language models—explain a substantial portion of variance in human similarity judgments. However, some variance is uniquely captured by behavioral features, suggesting that DNNs and humans focus on overlapping but distinct aspects of social scenes.
